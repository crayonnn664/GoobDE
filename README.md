Special Thanks:
raysfire for his tutorials.
JarateKing for documentation.
Whisker for BudHud which I used as a reference point for a lot of the HUD elements I couldn't quite figure out (plus I stole the chat box directly from the HUD teehee).
Griever for ToonHUD which I use as inspiration I guess.
And whoever decides to actually download and use this thing lmao.

GoobHUD Beta Version:
As of writing this file the HUD is in a severely incomplete state. I am only writing this to sort of journal my thoughts and track my progress. I will stick this through at least until the end regardless of how terrible I feel creating this thing sometimes.
I am about at the end of what I will call Version 1.0 of the HUD but I still have a few days of work left considering my inexperience with programming of any sort, graphic design, and general TF2 HUD making.
Version 1.0 will consist of changes to the bulk of the in-game portion of the HUD. I have tried to make as many changes to the default HUD as possible to tweak all of the parts I dislike to enhance visibilty whilst also keeping in line with the game's original artstyle by exclusively using the inbuilt textures and fonts.
I hope I did a good job.

Version 1.0:
